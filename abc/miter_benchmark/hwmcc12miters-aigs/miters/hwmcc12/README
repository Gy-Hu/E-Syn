Make sure you have

  abc
  aigmove
  aigreset
  aigmove
  aigmiter

installed and in your PATH.

Then add all or link all the AIGER benchmarks for which you want
to generate miters with suffix '.aig' into 'original'.  You can
use circuits with only outputs, with single or multiple bad state
properties and also with environment constraints.  But liveness
and fairness are not supported.

Then run 'generate.sh' which will first move outputs and reset non-zero
initialized latches.  The result of this first phase is stored in
the 'move' directory.  Next the trivial combinational miters between
two structural identical copies of the moved circuits are generated in
'nonopt'.  Note, that next state functions are treated as outputs and
are also checked for equivalence.  Then ABC is used to optimized
the moved circuits.  The result is copied to the 'abc' directory.
This finally allows to generate more realistic miters between
the moved circuits and its optimized variant in 'opt'.
